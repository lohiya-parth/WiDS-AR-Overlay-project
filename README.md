This project explores image processing and AR overlays using Python, OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy, and MediaPipe.
Week 0: Basic image operations—loading, format conversion, resizing, color conversion, and sharpening.
Week 1: Background removal and replacement using GrabCut.
Week 2: Face landmark overlays on videos with dynamic scaling and alpha blending.
Week 3: Real-time AR overlays on webcam with forehead, nose, and mouth placement.
Week 4: Advanced live AR system supporting multiple landmarks, background removal, dynamic resizing, and interactive keyboard control.
Skills gained include image manipulation, face detection, AR overlay design, and real-time video processing.
