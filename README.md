Week 1: Background Manipulation using GrabCut

This project demonstrates **background removal and replacement** using Python and OpenCV's **GrabCut** algorithm.  
It allows you to extract a person (foreground) from an image and overlay them onto a new background.

## Features

- Load foreground (person) and background images
- Remove background using **GrabCut**
- Resize extracted foreground
- Overlay foreground onto a new background at a custom position
- Display and save the final composite image
